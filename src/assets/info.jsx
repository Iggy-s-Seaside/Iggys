    "In 1983, Mary Weise saw potential in a property in downtown Seaside. She invited her son, Dooger, to join her in starting a restaurant, and they embarked on a culinary adventure together. With Dooger as the head chef and Mary as the skilled prep cook, they transformed their establishment, Dooger's Seafood and Grill, into a beloved seaside institution over four decades.";

    "In 2011, Carnegie Wiese, Dooger's son, returned to help run the family business. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Carnegie turned the parking lot into an outdoor dining oasis with picnic tables and a firepit, ensuring Dooger's survival. Recognizing the opportunity for permanent transformation, Carnegie consulted his college friend, Vito Surreli, to design an innovative indoor-outdoor bar that captures the essence of the coast. Their vision includes welcoming dogs and a fresh, artistically infused modern ambiance that brings a unique charm to Seaside.";
